Known issues
============

Doesn't work well together with `Caffeine` this is because `Caffeine` fakes user activity instead of doing it the right way and setting hooks in the system. A tool that sets system hooks instead of faking user activity is [iCanSleep](http://www.koboldtouch.com/display/ICS/iCanSleep+-+Prevent+your+Mac+from+Sleeping).
