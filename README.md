## Known "issues"

Doesn't work well together with Caffeine this is because Caffeine fakes user activity instead of doing it the right way and setting hooks in the system. A tool that sets system hooks instead of faking user activity are [Amphetamine (iTunes link)](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12&at=11l4L8) or [iCanSleep](http://www.koboldtouch.com/display/ICS/iCanSleep+-+Prevent+your+Mac+from+Sleeping).
