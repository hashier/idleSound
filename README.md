## Features and Settings

You can set the idle time after which the Mac should be muted further you can chose whether the Mac should be muted when the screens turn off or the screensaver starts. Both settings can be disabled through the menu bar.


## Known issues

Doesn't work well together with `Caffeine` this is because `Caffeine` fakes user activity instead of doing it the right way and setting hooks in the system. A tool that sets system hooks instead of faking user activity is [iCanSleep](http://www.koboldtouch.com/display/ICS/iCanSleep+-+Prevent+your+Mac+from+Sleeping).
