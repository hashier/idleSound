Both settings can be disabled through the menu bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nDoesn't work well together with `Caffeine` this is because `Caffeine` fakes user activity instead of doing it the right way and setting hooks in the system. A tool that sets system hooks instead of faking user activity is [iCanSleep](http://www.koboldtouch.com/display/ICS/iCanSleep+-+Prevent+your+Mac+from+Sleeping).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
